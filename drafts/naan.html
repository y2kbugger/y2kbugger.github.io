<p>Mix all of the <cite>Whisk in bowl</cite> ingredients. Set aside for about 10 minutes, or while weighing up the flour.</p>
<p>Weigh up the flour.</p>
<p>Incorporate the wet into the dry via the well method.</p>
<p>Fold until shaggy and incorporated
Let starch granules activate in absence of salt for 15 to 20 minutes. Should become less sticky.</p>
<p>Next, add 1 Tbl AP flour at a time, until dough is just handleable.</p>
<p>Transfer to well oiled bowl.</p>
<p>Cover and proof in a warm area, I heated to the oven to 125F and turned it off while leaving light on. Let rise for about 1-3 hours until doubled in size.</p>
<p>In meantime mince up 2 heads of garlic to about the size of a lentil. Some will go into dough, the rest into the butter.</p>
<p>Melt a stick of butter of butter over very low heat. Skim the milk solids off of the top. Then separate the fat from the aqueous phase. You can either skim, pour with a measurement cup or use a gravy separator.  You don't want wet butter, going for approximation of ghee. Add 1/3 of garlic to the butter and heat slightly.</p>
<p>Fold in 2tsp salt and the remaining 2/3rds of garlic into dough during deflation. Knead a bit enough to get the dough mass together and gluten in some tension. Portion into 65g pieces, dough was extremely sticky. Do the best you can and get them separated. After setting them on silicone pad I added little oil to the outside of each and shaped into ball with oiled hand. This maybe could have been done better by oiling hands before portioning step...?</p>
<p>Let proof for about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Heat cast iron between 450 and 500. Should have a very well seasoned surface. These going basically dry because it's hot enough that it would burn any oil.</p>
<p>Transfer a proofed ball to the to the stretching surface, dust surface with flour before setting it down. Use flour to keep things from sticking.
Stretch out thin, remember it will rise. I started out using a rolling pin, but to be honest the dough is conducive to just hand stretching and lifting allowing it to thin out.</p>
<p>Throw on the cast iron surface if there's any folds quickly lay them flat. Liberally apply garlic butter to uncooked side. Can drip some down and swish the whole thing around to get a little bit on the cooking side too. Try and get some garlic pieces also.</p>
<p>When some spots start to be dark on the bottom flip the entire piece over directly over the flame if you have a little grate that helps a lot. You can use pretty intense heat and move the naan around once it twice to get charring more widespread. Should have 30 seconds approximately on the flame.</p>
<p>Remove from fire with tongs. They are now ready to eat.</p>

<h2>What to do with 6 ripe persimmons?</h2>
<p>Whenever I visit <a class="reference external" href="https://junglejims.com/">Jungle Jim's</a>, a Cincinnati international market known as &quot;a theme park of food&quot;, I make sure to hunt for a new fruit. After grabbing a few interesting specimens to try, I found a section that I had never noticed before: clearance fruit. Normally overripe fruit wouldn't be too exciting, but persimmons are best when super-ripe. I took home a six pack, but I didn't have a plan for them yet.</p>
<img alt="Clearance persimmons from Jungle Jims." src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KPn2fFh0X5Zq5ESGRaKgGDazFb6E7Rr4x5MsFJyO2akgwTP3qC_h2QCRDb6jA2uWX-2gMh7Qwqw9zrSmDSoNIPOBjisS7WHm05LkEqkDxe45oMZTsZsA1YxXmTtCIQOEuza8BTvRdpQ=w790-h508-no" />
<p>After a bit of googling, I settled on making an English style holiday pudding. Not being British, this was a dish I was only vaguely aware of. After reading about the dessert a bit on the internet, I had a case of what googling calls the <a class="reference external" href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/153166/what-is-the-term-for-when-you-become-more-aware-of-something">Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon</a>. It was everywhere. The strongest example was when I went to see a Christman Carol <em>again</em>, I can't believe that the &quot;pudding scene&quot; had always been there, never stirring my brain to ask &quot;wtf is this pudding?&quot; before, I think I thought it was meat.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="directions">
<h2>Directions</h2>
<div class="section" id="step-1-prepare-the-mold">
<h3>Step 1 - Prepare the mold</h3>
<p>Traditionally one would use an English pudding mold, I didn't have that so I buttered a large stainless steel mixing bowl. I used a stock pot as the boiler setting the mixing bowl on top. Add enough water to the stockpot to come halfway up the mold; to gauge depth, test this with an empty mold by pressing in into the water.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-prepare-the-dry-ingredients">
<h3>Step 2 - Prepare the dry ingredients</h3>
<p>Sift flour, and add all &quot;dry&quot; ingredients to a bowl. Stir until evenly distributed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-simmer-the-tasty-bits">
<h3>Step 3 - Simmer the tasty bits</h3>
<p>Toast pecans in a frying pan and add all &quot;Simmered&quot; ingredients. Simmer for about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat; let stand for 15 minutes, allowing time for fruit to soak up excess moisture and become tender.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4-combine-the-wet-stuff">
<h3>Step 4 - Combine the wet stuff</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, slice tops off persimmons. Note: Original recipe says to press the fruit through sieve to remove skin. This is hopeless with a normal strainer and it's not hard to just separate skins by hand. Scoop out flesh, discard skins. (you should have 2 3/4 cups persimmon puree). Whisk in milk</p>
<p>Cream butter and sugar; then add the rest of the &quot;Wet&quot; ingredients to the butter mixture. If you are using an electric mixer be sure to keep the bowl scraped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-5-bring-it-all-together">
<h3>Step 5 - Bring it all together</h3>
<p>Using minimal mixing, fold in all of the dry ingredients over a few quick additions. While still partially unmixed dump in &quot;simmered&quot; mixture of pecans, raisins, ginger, etc. Fold all until just barely mixed. Pour into prepared mold and cover with lid.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-4-let-it-steam">
<h3>Step 4 - Let it steam</h3>
<p>Bring water in stockpot to a boil. I let this go ~8 hours because of the size, 6 probably would have been ok. Since it's being steamed it can really get overcooked unless it starts to dry out. Time really depends on shape of mold+pot and the size of the pudding. Use a toothpick or skewer and test that the center is no longer a batter before calling it done.</p>
