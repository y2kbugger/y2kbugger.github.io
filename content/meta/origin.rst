:summary: I explain how I use dates on this blog. The purpose of this blog is to showcase my projects past and future and so publication dates shouldn't be taken as the actual data the article was written.

Purpose of this blog
====================
The reason this site exists is to track and showcase my various projects. I
value having an accurate timeline of when the projects were worked on more than
when they were written about.

Use of dates
------------
To have an accurate project timeline, I will make the date of an article be the
date when a project or stage of a project was completed. So you can still know
when an article was publish, I will use the last modified on field even for new
articles. This not only ensures an accurate timeline, but it gives the
opportunity to go back and curate past projects.

Historical stubs
----------------
For some historical projects I plan to just make a stub article and include a few photos. If there is interest in any one of them in particular I will update with more details. This can also just serve as an index for when I need to showcase my talents; I can elaborate on them in person.
