What to do with 6 ripe persimmons?
==================================
Whenever I visit `Jungle Jim's <https://junglejims.com/>`_, a Cincinnati international market I make sure to hunt for some a new fruit. After grabbing a few interesting fruits to try, I found a section that I had never noticed before: clearance fruit. I found a good deal on persimmons that were perfectly ripe. I didn't have a plan for them yet.

After a bit of googling, I decided to make an english style holiday pudding. As an Ohio native, this was a dish I was only vaguely aware of and so after researching the dessert, the `Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon <https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/153166/what-is-the-term-for-when-you-become-more-aware-of-something>`_ came into effect hard. Kinda thought I was losing my mind when we went to see Scrooge *again* that noticed the "Pudding" scene before.

Once I got home they immediately when into the freezer to give me time until I had the opportunity to use them up.
