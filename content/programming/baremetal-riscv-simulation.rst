Start from nothing
==================

Usually when you start working on an embedded project, you get a toolkit. I didn't know this but still knew I wanted to understand what I takes to get a cpu up and running actual code.

Explain Renode setup
Explain documentation sources

ELF as used by renode

Setting up GCC for targeting Risc-V

Explain process of setting up interupt

Explain hardware registers (refer to Miro Samek blinkly light)

Explain that I will be cloning MIROS following each of his videos.
